# Project Overview

In this project,I will cover the full process of creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error using Python and Jupyter.




# Machine learning project steps

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.


* `machine_learning.ipynb` - the main project code
* `data_prep.ipynb` - the code to generate the team-level dataset from an athlete-level dataset

# What I have used...

* Python 3.8+
* Python packages
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * scikit-learn
    * seaborn


## Data

I'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
